DESCRIPTION

In our program there is a character — Mickey Mouse — on a grid screen that is moved by the player (see instructions below for more information), and the purpose and goal for the character is to get to a final destination — Minnie Mouse. However, to actually be able to get to find Minnie Mouse, mickey will have to collect at least 6 special collectables (shield, water, potions) which will randomly appear on the map one at a time by moving to those locations. Once you have gotten all the collectables, the final destination will unlock. If you do not have all the collectables, even if you physically get to the final destination, the game will not end, and you will still be considered playing. While you are doing this, you must also avoid some moving obstructions (fire and rock) or else you will die. If mickey lands on a black hole, he will be transported to a random location on the grid. Also, Mickey’s health is on the line, so as the program goes his health is declining, so he has to find minnie before his health vanishes. Everytime mickey collects a collectable, his health increases, though. Lastly, Mickey has to do this all in 90 seconds!

INSTRUCTIONS

The controls for the player are specified below:
Up arrow key- move 1 grid unit forward
Down arrow key - move 1 grid backward
Left arrow key - move 1 grid unit to the left
Right arrow key - move 1 grid unit to the right

If time runs out, Mickey’s health vanishes, or Mickey hit’s an obstruction, Mickey (player) will have lost the game. If Mickey gets to Minnie before all this, you will have won!
